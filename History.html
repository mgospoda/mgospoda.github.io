<p style="color:#565656; font-family:Brush Script MT; font-size: 25px;">"Christie and Chris knew each other in a cooking school and fell in love with each other in 1990. For Christie and Chris, cooking means far more than just a process of making something ready to eat, this is the career Christie and Chris decide to spend their whole life together."</p> 
<p style="color:#565656;font-family:Georgia;">After finishing cooking school, Christie and Chris decided to get married. After years of working at restaurants, Christie and Chris gained valuable insights into how great cookwares made cooking an enjoyable experience. They decided to quit their jobs and manufactured cookwares of high quality. The cookware from Christie and Chris's Cooking Cabin was all made by hand. The amazing design and quality of Christie and Chris's Cooking Cabin soon achieved success in the Great Chicago area. The passion for cooking and enthusiasm for life lies the foundation and tenant of Christie and Chris's Cooking Cabin. Since 1999, Christie and Chris's cooking cabin continually brought the joyfulness of cooking and ideas of a healthy diet to thousands of families through offering cookware and cooking classes. The product lines of cookware include pots, pans, utensils, aprons, and knives. Every cookware made by Christie and Chris's Cooking Cabin was delicate and durable, reflecting the pursuit of perfection of craftsmanship and the combination of utility and state of art. The cooking classes were hosted by invited star chefs from nearby restaurants on the Chicago campus. </p>
